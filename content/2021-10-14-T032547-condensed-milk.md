    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Keep the milk on the gas for heating and put sugar in it." 
    - "Keep stirring the milk continuously and cook it till it becomes thick. When the milk becomes half the amount of the original, add a little sweet soda to it. Keep stirring it continuously because after adding soda, the milk boils a lot. So make sure to keep stirring it continuously so that it does not stick to the bottom." 
    - "After some time of continuous boiling, you will see that the color of milk has started changing. You can check its consistency with the help of finger and thumb similar to that of sugar syrup." 
    - "When the milk starts feeling sticky and only Â¼ of the original amount remains, then that means your homemade condensed milk is ready." 
    - "Cool it down, fill it in a glass jar and keep it in the fridge and use it as needed. You can use it in cakes, barfi, halwa, kheer and many other types of sweets. It is very easy to make at home and can be made very cheaply at home." 

recipeNotes:
  - "Do not add too much sweet soda to milk." 
  - "Keep stirring the milk continuously so that it does not stick to the bottom."
