    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Sieve maida and add all other ingredients. Add oil and mix it well." 
    - "Add water little by little and knead the dough. The dough should neither be too hard nor too soft. The dough should be kneaded similarly as we do for making puri." 
    - "Put the kneaded dough in a vessel to rest for 15 to 20 minutes." 
    - "Now we will take a bowl and make a thick batter of ghee and maida in it. We also call it Sata." 
    - "Our rested dough is set well. Now make a roll out of the dough and make small balls and roll them into the shapes of roti." 
    - "Roll out as many layers as you want. I have made 5 rotis." 
    - "For the layer mathri, we will take one roti and put Sata on it and then keep the second roti on it, and repeat the process the same way." 
    - "Similarly, you have to make a roll by applying Sata on all the rotis, and cut small balls of it and roll it lightly with a rolling pin. At this time, all our mathris are ready to be fried." 
    - "Now put oil in the pan on the gas. After the oil becomes hot, fry the mathris on medium flame till they become golden." 
    - "Finally, our very delicious and crispy Mathris are ready. Enjoy it as a snack with tea."
