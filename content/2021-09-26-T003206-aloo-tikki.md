    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "First boil the potatoes in the cooker. Then mash them after cooling." 
    - "Now add rice flour, cornflour, black pepper powder, cumin powder, and salt according to taste in the mashed potatoes. Mix them well and knead it like a dough and make it smooth by applying some ghee." 
    - "Then by applying a little ghee on the hands, we will make small dough balls and make them round and give the shape of a tikki. Repeat this process for making all tikkis.." 
    - "Put ghee or oil (your choice) in the pan on the gas and shallow or deep fry the cake. I have shallow fried in ghee." 
    - "Fry the tikkis on low flame only. When the tikkis are cooked from one side, flip them and fry them on the other side till golden brown. Fry them by pressing them a little so that our tikkis are well fried from inside. Finally, take it out of the ghee/oil." 
    - "Frying is done and our tikkis are ready. " 
    - "Garnish them before serving. For that, add roasted cumin powder, chili powder, and other garnishing ingredients and serve hot." 
    - "Our Aloo Tikki seems very crispy and tasty.  Enjoy."
