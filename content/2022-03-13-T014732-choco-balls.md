  - recipeInstructionsTitle: "For making Choco Balls from Parle-G Biscuits"
    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Make small pieces from Parle-G Biscuits and put them in a mixer jar. Grind them finely. Then sieve the ground powder." 
    - "Put milk cream and chocolate syrup in Parle G powder and knead its dough. Then break small pieces from it and make them into round (balls) shape and keep them in a tray." 
    - "Then keep this tray in the freezer for half an hour. After half an hour the tray is taken out from the freezer." 
    - "Now cut the chocolate compound into pieces with a knife and take it in a bowl and melt it in the microwave. If there is no microwave, then you can melt the chocolate by placing water in a vessel on the gas and placing the pot of chocolate over it. Similarly, we melt the white chocolate." 
    - "Dip the Parle-G balls in the melted white and brown chocolates, and take it out with the help of a fork and put butter paper in a tray and place balls on it." 
    - "After the chocolate balls are dry, take it out of the butter paper and place it in a serving tray and decorate the ball with some sprinkles." 
    - "There you have it. Your very tasty sweet Chocolate Balls from Parle-G Biscuits are ready. Make it and enjoy it with your kids." 

recipeNotes:
  - "1. Keep the chocolate balls in the fridge, because they melt when kept outside." 
  - "2. If you are left with melted chocolate, put it in an ice tray and freeze the chocolate. This way your very own homemade chocolate will be ready."
