### Tips:

*  Add tea bags while cooking chickpeas in the pressure cooker, thatâ€™s because the tea bags help in giving chole a dark brown/black color.
* You can use canned chickpeas to Reduce the pressure cooking time. I do not prefer to use canned products and processed food. But the choice is yours
