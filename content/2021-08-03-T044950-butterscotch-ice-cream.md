    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Put a pan on the gas and put half a cup of sugar in it and stir it till it melts." 
    - "The sugar has to be allowed to melt well. To caramelize it, it has to be cooked on low flame only." 
    - "After the sugar becomes dark in color, add some cashew pieces and a spoonful of ghee and stir it well. Then turn off the gas and put it in a plate rubbed with ghee, and freeze it. After it cools down, crush it." 
    - "Now put a pan on the gas and add full fat milk and boil it. Add sugar to it and stir it, then add one big spoon of milk powder and mix it well." 
    - "On the other side of the stove, we will take milk separately in a bowl and make a batter by adding cornflour to it." 
    - "Then add a little cornflour solution to the boiling milk and keep stirring until the solution becomes thick, then turn off the gas." 
    - "Take half cup whipped cream in a bowl and whisk it with an electric beater or hand whisker for 5 to 7 minutes." 
    - "Mix the milk mixture which we had prepared with the cream, and again whip the whole mixture and mix it well." 
    - "When the mixture becomes thick, then take a box or kulfi mold and grease it with ghee and put the ice cream mixture in it. " 
    - "Now break the sugar cashew caramel that we had made, and add it to the box and make it uniform by tossing it little by little." 
    - "Lastly, by applying foil paper, close the lid tightly and keep it in the freezer for 8-10 hours.    " 
    - "Your Butterscotch Ice Cream is ready. Garnish it with the remaining caramel. Now serve it with a scoop or spoon. "
