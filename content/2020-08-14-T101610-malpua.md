To prepare this mouth-watering delicacy, all you need is wheat flour, Ghee, Sugar & some easy available home ingredients. Malpua is deep fried in ghee & better known to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, which will melt in your mouth in just a minute. 

Ghee is traditionally used for frying malpua but you can use oil  for deep fry but i prefer to use Ghee instead of oil. For better taste you can pair it up with rabdi as well.
