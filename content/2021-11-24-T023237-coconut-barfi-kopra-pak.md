  - recipeInstructionsTitle: "For making Coconut Barfi (Kopra Pak)"
    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "To make Coconut Barfi (Kopra Pak), first of all, sieve the mawa and grate it so that no lumps remain." 
    - "Now we will cook the grated mawa in a pan on the gas. We have to keep stirring the mawa continuously so that it does not stick to the bottom." 
    - "We do not have to bake the mawa till it becomes golden, its color should remain white." 
    - "After stirring the mawa for 5-7 minutes, add sugar and keep stirring it till it melts well. Keep checking that there should be no sugar grains in it at all." 
    - "When the mawa batter starts thickening gradually, then turn off the gas and add cardamom powder and mix it and let it cool down a bit." 
    - "After that, put the desiccated coconut in it and stir it well and when the Kopra Pak cools down properly and becomes set, then it has to be frozen in the tray." 
    - "For freezing, put ghee in the tray and put the mawa-Kopra mixture in it and spread it well and put almond pistachio shavings on it and press it slightly." 
    - "It will freeze well for 3-4 hours. After that, cut the Kopra Pak into the desired shape and then decorate it on a plate." 
    - "Your halwai-style Kopra Pak is ready to eat. It is very tasty and soft."
