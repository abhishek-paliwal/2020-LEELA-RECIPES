recipeInstructions:
  - recipeInstructionsTitle: "For making Mango Semolina Cake"
    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Take a mango, wash it, peel it, and chop it." 
    - "Then put it in a mixer jar and grind it with sugar and keep the mango pulp aside." 
    - "Now take oil in a bowl and add powdered sugar in it and whisk well." 
    - "Then add semolina and already-made mango pulp to it, and mix it well." 
    - "Add milk as per need, and whisk well." 
    - "Grease the cake mold with oil, and dust it by adding a little all-purpose flour (maida)." 
    - "Now put a stand in a pressure cooker, and place the cooker on the stove. Put salt in it and preheat for 10 minutes." 
    - "Then, in the cake mixture, add baking powder, baking soda, and 1 spoon of vinegar. Mix them all." 
    - "After adding the cake mixture to the cake tin, tap it slightly. Add some dry fruits on top and gently place the cake tin in the pre-heated cooker." 
    - "Cover the lid and let it cook for 40-50 minutes. Keep the stove heat very low. Be careful not to put the whistle on the lid of the pressure cooker." 
    - "If you want, you can check the cake after 30-35 minutes by using a knife. If the cake batter is sticking in the knife, then our cake is still raw now. Let it cook some more if that's the case." 
    - "Close the lid immediately, and allow it to cook again for a while. In my case, the cake has taken about 50 minutes to fully cook." 
    - "After cooking, take the cake out of the cooker, and let it cool." 
    - "Now take out the cake from the cake mold. You can see that the cake would come out to be very soft." 
    - "Finally, we will garnish the cake with chopped mangoes and place it on a serving plate. Our delicious Mango Semolina Cake is ready to be enjoyed."
