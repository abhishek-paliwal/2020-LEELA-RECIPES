  - recipeInstructionsTitle: "For making Mawa Gujiya"
    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "First of all, roast the mawa till it becomes golden. Keep stirring it continuously so that the mawa does not stick to the bottom. When it becomes granular, then turn off the gas and leave it to cool down." 
    - "Then, add sugar powder, desiccated coconut, chopped dry fruits, raisins, cardamom powder, and chironji, and mix it well." 
    - "Our Gujiya stuffing is ready. Keep it aside and let’s now prepare gujiya dough." 
    - "Sieve all-purpose-flour (maida) in a bowl and add a spoon of ghee. Mix and mash it well so that no lumps remain in it." 
    - "Now add a little water to this and make semi soft dough. After kneading the dough, keep it covered for 7 to 8 minutes. After some time our dough is ready to make gujiyas." 
    - "Now make a roll from this dough and break small balls from it and roll it into a round shape." 
    - "Now take a mold for making gujiya, place the rounded shape on the mould, fill two spoons of mawa stuffing in it, apply water all around to stick it, and give the shape of gujiya by folding the mold." 
    - "Similarly make all the gujiyas, and after 10-15 minutes, put oil in the pan and fry it on medium flame. Do not turn them around much  because it might break the gujiyas while frying." 
    - "When the gujiyas become light pink while frying, take them out from the oil. You can also fry them in ghee if so desired." 
    - "Our Mawa Gujiya is ready. Put them on a plate and decorate them with rose leaves and dry fruits.That’s how you make the very tasty and delicious Mawa Gujiya. Celebrate this dish with your loved ones." 

recipeNotes:
  - "Roast the mawa till it turns pink so that our gujiya can be stored for 10 to 15 days ." 
  - "Do not fill the gujiyas with too much stuffing as they may burst while frying." 
  - "Keep the gujiyas in an airtight container only after they cool down."
