    recipeIngredientList:
    - "Ghee, 2 Tbsp" 
    - "Wheat Porridge, 250 Grams (One Big Bowl)" 
    - "Sugar / Jaggery, 250 Grams Or As Per Taste" 
    - "Water, Three Bowls Or As Required" 
    - "Cashews Chopped, 1 To 2 Teaspoons" 
    - "Almond Shredding, 3 To 4 Teaspoons"

recipeInstructions:
  - recipeInstructionsTitle: "For making Lapsi"
    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Keep a pan on the gas. Add porridge and ghee into it, roast it well slowly." 
    - "Make sure to add some extra ghee, because this will make our Lapsi shiny and very tasty." 
    - "Keep stirring the porridge continuously and roast it till it turns nice deep golden." 
    - "As soon as the porridge gets properly roasted for Lapsi, it will start releasing ghee and by that time our mixture will become golden brown." 
    - "On the other side of the stove, we will keep water in the pan to heat up. Keep in mind that if there is one bowl of porridge, then three bowls of water have to be taken because the porridge is of different types, so this measurement is universally perfect." 
    - "Now we will slowly pour hot water into the golden mixture. Be careful while pouring water so that hot water does not splash on your hands." 
    - "Now stir the porridge well and cover, and let it cook till the water dries up. Open the lid a couple of times while cooking to check whether our porridge is cooked or not." 
    - "You can see that the water of Lapsi has dried completely. Now add sugar in it. You can change the amount of sugar according to your taste preference." 
    - "We have to keep stirring continuously till the sugar melts so that it does not stick to the bottom because sticking spoils its taste." 
    - "With time our Lapsi is starting to thicken up. At that time, add cardamom powder and mix it well." 
    - "Finally add cashew pieces, almond shreddings and raisins to it and mix it well. Even without the dry fruits, there will not be much difference in the final taste. So, this is optional." 
    - "There we go. Our delicious Rajasthani Lapsi is ready." 
    - "We will take it on a serving plate and garnish it with coconut pieces, and serve hot."
