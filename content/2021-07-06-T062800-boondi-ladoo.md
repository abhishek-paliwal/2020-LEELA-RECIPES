    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "Sieve the gram flour in a vessel and add water to it as needed. Then, make a thin batter." 
    - "If you want, you can also add a pinch of baking soda to the solution." 
    - "Now leave the solution covered for 10 to 15 minutes, so that it sets well." 
    - "Now to make boondi, put oil in a pan on the gas and heat it well." 
    - "Then take a sieve and keep it high over the oil and pour the gram flour mixture little by little, keeping in mind that the solution has to be kept in the oil by moving the hand." 
    - "Keep in mind that boondi does not become too golden, because we have to make laddus, so we have to cook it less and keep it a little soft." 
    - "Take out the boondi from the oil and put it in a vessel." 
    - "Now to make sugar syrup, put sugar and water in a pan on the gas and keep stirring till the sugar melts. Add a little yellow color, cardamom powder and lemon juice in it." 
    - "Cook the sugar syrup till it becomes sticky, then turn off the gas." 
    - "Then put the boondi that we have prepared in the sugar syrup, and mix it well and add dry fruits, almond shavings, rose leaves, and two spoons of ghee, and mix it well." 
    - "Keep it covered for 15 to 20 minutes so that the boondi absorbs the syrup well." 
    - "Now we will make small laddus out of it and keep it in a plate, and decorate it with rose leaves and cashew nuts." 
    - "Now our yummy Boondi Ladoos are ready. These laddus will come out indeed very tasty."
