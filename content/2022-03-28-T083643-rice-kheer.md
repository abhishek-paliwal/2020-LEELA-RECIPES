    recipeInstructionsList:

    - "Wash the rice thoroughly an hour before using it for making Kheer." 
    - "After boiling the milk, add soaked rice to it and keep stirring it continuously till it comes to a boil. After that you stir it every once in a while so that the kheer does not stick to the bottom. The taste of kheer can be spoiled if it sticks to the bottom."

    - "Our kheer is slowly starting to boil and is thickening. The kheer is cooked well. Now we will put sugar in it and let the sugar dissolve well."

    - "There you have it. Your creamy and aromatic rice kheer is ready. You can eat it cold or hot as you like. Cold kheer also tastes delicious."
