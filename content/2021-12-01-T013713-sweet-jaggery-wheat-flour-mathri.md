  - recipeInstructionsTitle: "For making Sweet Jaggery Wheat Flour Mathri"
    recipeInstructionsList:
    - "In a vessel, dissolve the jaggery in water thoroughly. Jaggery should be dissolved well in water, then filter the water of jaggery in another vessel so that no other object or pebbles etc. remain in the jaggery in it." 
    - "Now sieve the wheat flour in a vessel and after adding sesame, fennel and semolina, add hot oil and mix all the things well. Keep in mind that the oil is hot, so do not mix it by hand, mix it with a spoon." 
    - "Now add jaggery water little by little in the flour and knead the dough. We don't have to knead the dough too hard. Then grease it with some oil and keep it covered for 10 minutes." 
    - "After this, make the dough smooth, then roll it, and cut it into big pieces and roll each piece into the shape of a roti." 
    - "Now you can cut this big roti into small puris with a small glass or cookie cutter. Remove the extra dough and pierce the mathri with a fork so that it does not puff up and becomes crispy." 
    - "After this, leave all the mathris like this for 10 minutes. Then fry them in a pan in hot oil on medium flame until they become crisp. Finally, take them out of the oil." 
    - "There you have it. Your crispy mathris made with jaggery and flour are ready to eat."
